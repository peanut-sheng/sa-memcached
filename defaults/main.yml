# defaults file for sa-memcached


# EXAMPLE: If I wanted to run Memcached on port 1337, with 4GB of memory, and allow a maximum of 2,000 connections, I would change the config file as follows.
# Letâ€™s edit the configuration file:

# /etc/memcached.conf

# To the following:

#  memcached_properties:
#    - {regexp: "^-p .*", line: "-p 1337"}
#    - {regexp: "^-m .*", line: "-m 4096"}
#    - {regexp: "^-c .*", line: "-c 2000"}
